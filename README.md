# HOW AND WHY IT STARTS

The UI design was developed by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/emmanuel-messias-535621127/">Emmanuel Messias</a> for <a href="https://www.devchallenge.com.br/">DevChallenge</a>, and on this article I'm going to tell you about how was the process of creating this Headphone's landing page.

Prototypes: there was no Adobe XD or Figma prototypes for the initial idea, and it was bad and good for these two reasons:

- **Bad**: using prototypes, the work is clearly more efficient and fast to make it all done.

- **Good**: without it, I could have a basis for sizing and how I would insert blocks inside of the website. Then probably on the future, things like flexbox concepts, em/rem units and correct font-sizing will be automatic.

## MOBILE FIRST CONCEPT
The idea is user experience. With a little research it is possible to know which shopping sites is most used by mobile users. And for developing it is technicaly simple to make it done as [Polypane](https://polypane.app/blog/responsive-design-ground-rules/) tell us on this article.
  

## THE FIRST STEPS

There was no prototypes, then the first thing I did was think about how every item would be set in a block. On home section for example, it was possible to recongnize that there was two block (an image, and a information block) and both would be resized as screen width is changed.

Then, the first items list was created for this project:

 - HTML
	- Identify what will be Flexbox, Block, Inline
     - Default body
       		- Header with navbar
       		- Home section
       		- Info sectio
- CSS
	- Format root settings
	- Import font
		- Code

With all this, a diagram ~~not so beauty, but understandable~~ was made and became a basis for all elements used.

You can see the diagram [right here](https://github.com/alysonvilela/fone-landing-page/projects/3).

## CSS REQUIREMENTS
Remember, there was no grid template, then i used a couple basic resources for it.

**Most used resources:**
- Flexbox
    - Flex direction
    - Justify-content
    - Align-items
- Padding
- Margin
- Media Query

## ADAPTS
As the project was going, could percept that all thing was so **crude*, then I've done a couple ajustments.

The elements used for it was a **shadow-box** at **.contents** on desktop layout. Also added a animations on the headphone's image block, calling user's attention for it beauty and design.

## FINAL PROJECTS

*OBS: At the navbar, I've inserted a span on icons place for represent what it would be.*
